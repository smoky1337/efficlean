Welcome to EffiClean, a lightweight tool designed to help property managers and cleaning teams efficiently schedule cleaning tasks for short-term rental properties. This tool currently integrates with **Smoobu**, a popular booking management system, to generate optimized cleaning schedules and ensure a seamless guest experience.

## **Project Goals**

EffiClean simplifies the planning and execution of cleaning schedules by:
1. **Optimizing Cleaning Dates**: Suggests the most efficient days (i.e. the least amount of trips to site) for cleaning across multiple properties at a single site to minimize workload and maximize turnaround time.
2. **Streamlining Communication**: Provides cleaning staff with clear, detailed schedules with all nescessary information.
3. **Customizable Options**:
   - Adjust the maximum number of uncleaned days.
   - Filter specific subsets of apartments
4. **Guest Preparation Assistance**:
   - Displays the number of guests for the next booking, ensuring cleaning staff prepare the correct number of beds and amenities.

## **Features**

1. **Seamless Integration with Smoobu**:
   - Automatically fetch booking data, including check-in and check-out dates.

2. **Intelligent Scheduling**:
   - Generate cleaning plans that balance workload and prioritize reducing the number of visits of cleaning staff.

3. **Customizable Parameters**:
   - Set rules such as the maximum number of uncleaned days.

4. **Staff-Friendly Outputs**:
   - Provide clear, actionable schedules as color-coded PDFs to cleaning staff, ensuring they have all necessary details to prepare properties efficiently.

5. **Guest-Specific Preparation**:
   - Highlight the number of guests staying in the next booking, enabling staff to prepare the correct number of beds and other essentials.

## **Getting Started**

First, you need to generate an API key for Smoodu. Further information can be found here [link to smoodu].
You can build the app yourself to run locally or use the Dockerfile to run it on a server / docker provider of your choice.  

1. Clone this repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smoky1337/efficlean.git
```
2. Install dependencies  

Efficlean is build on Python 3.9, but there should be no issues using any newer version. 
```bash
  cd cleaning-plan-optimizer
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create `config.json` by editing `config_template.json` and saving it  as `config.json` with your API-Key  


4. Test the application by using
````bash
python app.py
````
